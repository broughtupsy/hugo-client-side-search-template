Improvised body restraint with suit tether to unexpected vehicle U bolt for 3 pt stance to enable pole positioning and cut.  After debris cut, attached pole as translation path to solar array.  Rope hooked between airlock solar array cover structure as means to overcome frozen hydraulic damper of solar array hinge.  Both crew stood under rope and pushed until array freed suddenly which caused both crew to drift free until hauled themselves back in via umbilicals.
